He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes.[12][20] Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael.[21] Katherine said that although whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up.[22][23] Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the whippings, which had a deeper impact on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.[24] Michael said that during his youth he was lonely and isolated.[25]\nLater in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.[26] In 1965, the group won a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song \"Barefootin'\" and sang the Temptations' \"My Girl\".[27] From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight and Etta James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high school dances.[28][29] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.[30]\nThe Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown Records; their first single, \"Big Boy\", was released in 1968.[31] Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a version of \"Who's Lovin' You\".[32] After",

Thriller won Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. \"Beat It\" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male). \"Billie Jean\" won two Grammy awards: Best R B Song and Best R B Vocal Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer, respectively.[61]\nThriller won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical), acknowledging Bruce Swedien for his work on the album.[84] At the 11th Annual American Music Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit.[85] He also won Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. \"Beat It\" won Favorite Soul/R B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.[85][86] Thriller's sales doubled after the release of an extended music video, Michael Jackson's Thriller, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.[87][88]\nThe success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture,[88] and the album \"conquered racial divides\".[89] Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point, with about 2 for every album sold (equivalent to 6 in 2024), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for 12 each.[90] In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video (Longform).[61] Time described Jackson's influence at that point as \"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too.\"[90] The New York Times wrote \"in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else\".[91]\nIn November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a 5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement (equivalent to 15.8 million in 2024). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its \"New Generation\" theme, included",

Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and suggested using his song \"Billie Jean\", with revised lyrics, as its jingle.[92]\nOn January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry,[93] a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second- degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter.[94] Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the 1.5 million (equivalent to 4.5 million in 2024) settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor.[95][96] Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for 10 million (equivalent to 27.7 million in 2024). The second campaign covered 20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987 1988 world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as his deals with Pepsi.[92]\nThe Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers.[97] Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity.[98] During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from the Jacksons during \"Shake Your Body\".[99]",

    "content": "Increased tabloid speculation (1986 1987)\nJackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his skin.[110][111][112] His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo,[113] a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year,[113] and with vitiligo in 1986.[114] Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson used fair-colored makeup,[115] and possibly skin-bleaching prescription creams,[116] to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale.[117] Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, \"When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me.\"[118] He became friends with Klein and Klein's assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his first two children.[119]\nIn his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a dancer's body.[120] Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his life.[121] After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want to look like a \"spotted cow\". She said he had received more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become addicted to them.[122]",

He denied the story,[123] although it was alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber (according to Jackson, this was a promotional shot from an upcoming space opera featuring himself) to The National Enquirer.[124] It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a chamber. DiLeo added \"I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a health fanatic.\"[125]\nWhen Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, the media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended animals.[126] It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the \"Elephant Man\").[127] In June 1987, the Chicago Tribune reported Jackson's publicist bidding 1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an \"absorbing interest\" in Merrick, \"purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical significance\".[128]\nIn September 1986, using the oxygen chamber story, the British tabloid The Sun branded Jackson \"Wacko Jacko\", a name Jackson came to despise.[6][129] The Atlantic noted that the name \"Jacko\" has racist connotations, as it originates from Jacko Macacco, a monkey used in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s, and \"Jacko\" was used in Cockney slang to refer to monkeys in general.[130]\nJackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the 17-minute 30 million 3D film Captain EO, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro Disneyland.[131] After having been removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's death.[132] In 1987, Ebony reported that Jackson had disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses.[133] Katherine Jackson said this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller video,[134] which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in 1984.[135] In 2001, Jackson told an interviewer he was still a Jehovah's Witness.[136]",

The charity brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry. The Dangerous World Tour ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and grossed 100 million (equivalent to 220 million in 2024);\nJackson performed for over 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were outside the US.[181][182] Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World Foundation.[183] Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO for 20 million (equivalent to 45 million in 2024), a record-breaking deal that still stands.[184]\nFollowing the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White, Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton's inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research[185][186] and performed \"Gone Too Soon\", a song dedicated to White, and \"Heal the World\"\nat the gala.[187] Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read \"Welcome Home Michael\",[188] and was awarded an Officer of the National Order of Merit from President Omar Bongo.[189][190] During his trip to Ivory Coast, Jackson drew larger crowds than Pope John Paul II on his previous visits.[191] He was crowned \"King Sani\" by a tribal chief in the Ivorian village of Krindjabo, where he thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.[188]\nIn January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience figures.[192][193] With 133.4 million viewers, it was the first Super Bowl whose halftime show drew greater audience figures than the game.[194] Jackson played \"Jam\", \"Billie Jean\", \"Black or White\", and \"Heal the World\". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US albums chart after the performance.[110]\nJackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from loneliness.

There s no way I lose\".[200][201] On July 9, Jackson's investigator, Anthony Pellicano, met Jordan, who denied any abuse or inappropriate touching by Jackson.[202] Evan Chandler's lawyer would later call Beverly Hills psychiatrist Dr. Mathis Abrams and present him with a hypothetical situation. In reply and without having met either Jordan Chandler or his parents, Abrams sent Rothman a two-page letter in which he states that \"reasonable suspicion would exist that sexual abuse may have occurred\".[203] After receiving the letter from Dr. Abrams, Evan Chandler allegedly received a confession from his son Jordan,[203] and demanded 20 million from Jackson on August 4, 1993, without going to law enforcement regarding the reports of the abuse that was claimed to have taken place, but Jackson refused and sued Chandler for extortion.[200] From August 9 13, 1993, Evan Chandler and his legal team made various counter-offers to secure a settlement from Jackson, escalating their financial demands after his refusal to pay the initial 20 million, with Evan later filing a civil suit in September demanding 30 million for alleged damages[204] which were all denied by Jackson, prompting Chandler to go public with the claims of child molestation.[205][206][207] Jackson's older sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile;[208] she later retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive husband.[209]\nProsecutors raided Neverland Ranch and other places of residency while Jackson was on tour in August, but no leads were found as the investigators ruled that there was no medical evidence or physical evidence. Additionally hundreds of children were investigated but all of them stated no abuse or improper behavior had taken place.[210] Attention was later brought to two legal art books depicting featuring young boys playing, running, and swimming in various states of undress, however Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them. No child pornography or other incriminating evidence was found.[211][212] In December 1993, Prosecutor Thomas W. Sneddon Jr. filed a strip search on Jackson based on the drawing obtained by Jordan Chandler which had been sent to the authorities, however the drawing did not match and prosecutors sought out Jackson's doctors and family",

This motion was denied and in January 1994, the civil lawsuit was settled for 15,331,250, with separate payments of 1.5 million for Evan and June Chandler coming out to a total of 18.3 million allocated to the Chandler family, lower than the initial demand of 20 30 million requested by Evan Chandler.[216][217] The document shows that the Chandlers dropped the child molestation allegations from their complaint with Jackson's settlement being filed over claims of negligence. It was later revealed that this settlement did not prevent the Chandlers from testifying in the criminal case[218] The police never pressed criminal charges.[219] The prosecution continued to investigate Jackson from January to June 1994 with Jordan Chandler continuing to co-operate with investigators.[220] By July 1994 multiple grand juries had been called;\njurors remarked that no damaging evidence was heard against Jackson. \"The [Santa Barbara] grand jury in Michael Jackson's case was dismissed and one juror said he heard no evidence against [Jackson]... Another juror told CNN that he heard no evidence against him [Jackson] during the hearing.\"[221] On September 21, 1994, after 400 witnesses had been investigated with another 30 called in front of the grand juries, the investigation was closed. A few potential leads had been found but all of them turned out to be false.[222]\nJackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations.[223] On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi.[224]\nIn late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of Elvis Presley, over the phone.[225] They were married in La Vega, Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez Pérez.[226] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer.[226][227] Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December 1995.[228] Presley cited \"irreconcilable differences\" when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as her settlement.[227][229] After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, \"They lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year and a half.\"[226]\nPresley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him.[230]\nJackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited. Jackson's involvement was the subject of fan speculation for decades until Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka confirmed it in 2022.[231][232] Sega Technical Institute director Roger Hector and Sonic co-creator Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations.[233][234]\nHowever, Jackson's musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson's team said he went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the Genesis replicated his music.[235] The game's credits theme served as the basis for Jackson's 1996 song \"Stranger in Moscow\".[236]",

The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million shipments in the US.[237] It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies (40 million units) sold worldwide.[177][238] HIStory received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.[61] The New York Times reviewed it as \"the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his talent\".[239]\nThe first single from HIStory was \"Scream/Childhood\". \"Scream\", a duet with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100,[178]\nand received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals\".[61] The second single, \"You Are Not Alone\", holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[240]\nIt received a Grammy nomination for \"Best Pop Vocal Performance\" in 1995.[61]\nIn 1995 the Anti-Defamation League and other groups complained that \"Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me\", the original lyrics of \"They Don't Care About Us\", were antisemitic. Jackson released a revised version of the song.[241] In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic attack.[242] In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning 95 million up front (equivalent to 196 million in 2024) as well as the rights to more songs.[243][244]\n\"Earth Song\" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995.[180] It became the 87th-bestselling single in the UK.[245] At the 1996 Brit Awards, Jackson's performance of \"Earth Song\" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's \"Christ-like\" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was \"disgusting and cowardly\".[246][247]\nIn 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for \"Scream\" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.[61][248] In July 1996, Jackson performed for Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's fiftieth birthday at Jerudong Park Amphitheater, which was specifically built for that birthday concert.[249] Jackson was reportedly paid 17 million (equivalent to 34 million in 2024).[250] Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997.

The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the children of Guatemala.[257] Later that month, Jackson organized a series of \"Michael Jackson Friends\" benefit concerts in Germany and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram, Shobana, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO.[258] In 1999, Jackson was presented with the \"Outstanding Humanitarian Award\" at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City where he noted Mahatma Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him.[259][260] From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street.[261] At the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of the 1980s Decade Award at the 27th American Music Awards,[262] and the Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World Music Awards.[263] In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.[264] In September 2001, two concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa, Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny's Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli and Slash.

Jackson apologized for the incident, calling it \"a terrible mistake\".[275] On January 22, promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts.[276] In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram 5.3 million (equivalent to 9.3 million in 2024).[277][278] On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.[279]\nOn April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater.

The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists.[283] Jackson charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a \"fat nigger\".[284] Sony issued a statement calling the accusations \"ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful\" and said Mottola had championed Jackson's career for years.[283] Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract and said that a 25 million (equivalent to 43.7 million in 2024) promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible.[256]",

Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy Holmes, later said it was never finalized.[298][299] Holmes also found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits.[297] By September 2006, Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas.[299]\nIn April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then worth about 1 billion, as collateral against his 270 million worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of 300 million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to 470 million in 2024). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy.[244][300] The main house at Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah.[301] At least thirty of Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed 306,000 in back wages. Jackson was ordered to pay 100,000 in penalties.[244] Jackson never returned to Neverland after his acquittal.[302]\nIn mid-2006, Jackson moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording studio near Rosemount, County Westmeath, Ireland. There, he began work on a new album with the American producers will. i. am and Rodney Jenkins.[303] That November, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath.[177] On November 15, Jackson briefly joined in on a performance of \"We Are the World\" at the World Music Awards in London, his last public performance, and",

The deal gave Jackson the rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others.[306][307] In a brief interview, Jackson said he had no regrets about his career despite his problems and \"deliberate attempts to hurt [him]\".[308] That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to greet more than 3,000 troops and their families.[309][310] As of September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never completed.[311]\nIn 2008, for the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson and Sony released Thriller 25, with two remixes released as singles: \"The Girl Is Mine 2008\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\".[312] Thriller 25 was the last recorded work released during his life which he was extensively involved with, with Jackson co- producing the album's remix tracks. For his 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits albums, King of Pop, with different tracklists for different regions.[313] That July, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which he had used as collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony Capital LLC.[314] In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. The deal earned him 35 million.[315] In 2009, Jackson arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through Julien's Auction House, but canceled the auction in April.[316]\nIn March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson announced a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, at a press conference at the O2 Arena.[317] The shows were to be his first major concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for ten concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, the president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the first ten dates would earn Jackson 50 million.[318]\nThe London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking ticket sales; more than one million were sold in less than two hours.[319] The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of the choreographer Kenny Ortega, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Rehearsals took place at the Forum and the Staples Center owned by AEG.[320] By this point, Jackson's debt had grown to almost 500 million. By the time of his death, he was three or four months behind payments on his home in San Fernando Valley.[321][322] The Independent reported that Jackson planned a string of further ventures designed to recoup his debts, including a world tour, a new album, films, a museum and a casino.[317]",

The Jackson collaborator will. i. am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson would not have approved the release.[382]\nThe video game developer Ubisoft released a music game featuring Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, Michael Jackson: The Experience. It was among the first games to use Kinect and PlayStation Move, the motion-detecting camera systems for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[383] In April 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed, the chairman of Fulham Football Club, unveiled a statue of Jackson outside the club stadium, Craven Cottage.[384] It was moved to the National Football Museum in Manchester in May 2014,[385] and removed from display in March 2019 following renewed sexual assault allegations.[386]\nIn October 2011, the theater company Cirque du Soleil launched Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a 57-million production,[387] in Montreal, with a permanent show resident in Las Vegas.[388] A larger and more theatrical Cirque show, Michael Jackson: One, designed for residency at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013, in a renovated theater.[389][390]\nIn 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother Jermaine retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisors over the legitimacy of his brother's will.[391] T.

    "content": "Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations\nIn 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old (1989 1996).[403] In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging similar sexual abuse over a four-year period starting when Safechuck was ten (1988 1992).[404][405][406] Both had previously testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005.[407][408] In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed as it had been filed too late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.[409]\nIn 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable for his alleged past actions.[410][411] The rulings were appealed. On October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that Safechuck had had a relationship with Jackson's corporation, nor was it proven that there was a special relationship between the two.[412][413][414][415] On April 26, 2021, Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the defendants exercised control over Jackson.[416]\nRobson and Safechuck's allegations were the subject of the documentary film Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019.[417] Radio stations in New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their playlists.[418][419][420] Jackson's family condemned the film as a \"public lynching\",[421] and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a \"tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death\".[422] Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin, defended Jackson in the wake of the documentary's release, saying that Jackson had never molested them.[423][424][425]\nDocumentaries such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand: Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson: Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested by Leaving Neverland.[426][427][428] Jackson's album sales increased following the documentary screenings.[429] Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the controversy.[430] In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing \"positive listener survey results\".[431][432]\nOn February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in 100 million or more in damages awarded to the estate.[433] HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. In September 2019, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to arbitrate.[434]\nHBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court affirmed Wu's ruling.[435]\nIn 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits.

For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation.[438] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[439] Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R B, leading to the discontinuation of the album- oriented rock format previously dominant on the channel.[40][440] In songs such as \"Black or White\", \"Heal the World\", \"Earth Song\" and \"They Don't Care About Us\", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice.[441][442] He is considered one of the most significant figures of the 20th century,[443]\nand his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.[444][445][446][447]\nJackson's meteoric rise in the 1980s catapulted him to global stardom, and his influence transcended borders. In Africa, his influence was compared to Nelson Mandela for his ability to inspire and unite diverse audiences through his music.[448][449] Similarly, in India, Jackson was likened to Mahatma Gandhi, with his art championing themes of social justice and humanitarianism,[450] and his influence extending to Bollywood where it was said that anyone who danced well was compared to Jackson.[448] In Europe, Jackson's impact was compared to that of the Pope, drawing huge crowds of people who gathered to see the singer in public and even more to his concerts, which spread messages of love and healing during rough economic and political times.[451]\nHis presence in the Middle East was considered as widespread as Coca-Cola, symbolizing a shared global culture through his music.[452] Additionally, Jackson is considered the backbone of the K-pop industry in South Korea, influencing countless artists and shaping the genre's development.[453][454]\nTrying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact particularly in the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial success that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying to mimic some of the Jackson formula.\nJ.

He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever.\" He described Jackson as a \"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and color too.\"[90] In 2003, The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley described Jackson as \"extremely important\" and a \"genius\".[458] At Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson \"the greatest entertainer that ever lived\".[459][460]\nJackson is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.[461][462] He has also appeared on Rolling Stone's lists of the Greatest Singers of All Time.[463][464]\nCraig Glenday, the Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records, called Jackson the most famous person in the world in 2006. Following Jackson's death, Glenday wrote in an obituary that Jackson had maintained this status up until his death,[465] later remarking that his fame had exceeded that of Confucius.[466] The Guardian wrote that he was in a league of his own in terms of fame, noting that Jackson had become so famous that the number of people who might not know who he was had become statistically insignificant.[467] Due to his unprecedented influence, Jackson is recognized today as one of the most globally renowned figures in history. Reports of his fame extend from the Middle East,[468][469] Africa,[448][470] India,[471][472] and China[473][474] to tribes in the Amazon.[475]\nHis influence even reaches remote corners of the world such as São Tomé and Príncipe, or Tristan da Cunha, where tribute artists keep his legacy alive by celebrating his music.[476][477]\nIn 2018, the National Portrait Gallery named Jackson the most depicted cultural figure of the century,[478] later stating that Jackson's influence on art rivaled that of Jesus Christ.[479] Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery and curator of the Michael Jackson: On the Wall exhibition, described Jackson's impact on art as unprecedented and claimed in 2018 that Jackson was the most depicted figure in the history of contemporary art.[480]\nIn 2014, a comprehensive study conducted by researcher Young-Ho Eom at the University of Toulouse identified Jackson as one of the most influential people of all time.[481]\nThe study utilized advanced ranking methods, including 2D Rank and PageRank algorithms, to analyze the impact of historical figures. Jackson was prominently placed on the list of top influencers, alongside Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, Adolf Hitler, and Jesus Christ. An additional study conducted in 2013 also identified Jackson as one of the most influential people of all time. This study ranked Jackson at the top of the list, alongside Napoleon Bonaparte, highlighting the extraordinary influence and global recognition that Jackson achieved throughout his career.[482]",

Bruce Swedien, his long-time sound engineer, emphasized that a critical element of their vocal recordings are of him and Jackson trying numerous approaches to rhythmic, emotional and technical distinctions to consummate a \"sonic character\".[507] His stylings, such as common use of staccato, legato, falsetto as well as vocal hiccups,[508] adlibs, wailings and growls are all signature to his sound.[509][510]\nJackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to lyric tenor.[511] He was known for his intonation and vocal range.[463] Through each music release, his vocal development and changes were positively narrated by music journalists. With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities in his coming-of-age period had Rolling Stone comparing his vocals to the \"breathless, dreamy stutter\" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that \"Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly.\"[512] By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a \"fully adult voice\" that was \"tinged by sadness\".[513] The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks, \"he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth\" and he had a \"wretched tone\". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to \"smooth\" vocals.[514] Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed \"exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies\".[515] Joseph Vogel notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion.[516] Neil McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style \"was original and utterly distinctive\".[517]\nJackson performing during the Dangerous World Tour in Bucharest in 1992",

When Jackson was a small child, his mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being \"mesmerized\".[521]\nJackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs with the Supremes.[522] She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched her rehearse.[523] He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself.[524]\nChoreographer David Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \"Beat It\" and the \"Bad\" video.[525][526][527]",

He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not proficient in them.[528] When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally.[528] Describing the process, he said:\n\"I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody.\" These were shown in his demos for \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" where he vocalized the melody, bass instrumentals as well as lead and backing vocals by overlaying each component. The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.[528]",

Y. T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \"oddball\" music personas: \"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\"[540] With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.[513] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the",

In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \"We Are the World\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.[6]\nIn Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song \"Dirty Diana\".[541] The lead single \"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\" is a traditional love ballad, and \"Man in the Mirror\" is a ballad of confession and resolution. \"Smooth Criminal\" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and likely murder.[137] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical person.[542] The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like \"Jam\"\nand \"Remember the Time\". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; \"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS, homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as \"In the Closet\". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as \"Will You Be There\", \"Heal the World\", and \"Keep the Faith\".[514] In the ballad \"Gone Too Soon\", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with AIDS.[543]\nHIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia.[544] In the new jack swing-funk rock tracks \"Scream\" and \"Tabloid Junkie\", and the R B ballad \"You Are Not Alone\", Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media.[545] In the introspective ballad \"Stranger in Moscow\", Jackson laments his \"fall from grace\"; \"Earth Song\", \"Childhood\", \"Little Susie\", and \"Smile\" are operatic pop songs.[544][545] In \"D. S.\", Jackson attacks lawyer Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to \"get my ass, dead or alive\".[546] Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as \"Cry\" and \"The Lost Children\", ballads such as \"Speechless\", \"Break of Dawn\", and \"Butterflies\", and mixes hip hop, pop, and R B in \"2000 Watts\", \"Heartbreaker\", and \"Invincible\".[547][548]",

When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the \"Bad\" video as \"infamous\". It featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous cameo roles.[555][556] For the \"Smooth Criminal\" video, Jackson experimented with leaning forward at a 45-degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U. S. patent 5,255,452 (http://patft. uspto. gov/netacgi/nph-Parser? patentnumber 5255452) for the device.[557]\nThe video for \"Leave Me Alone\" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards[558] and won a Golden Lion Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.[61]\nHe received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed in his honor.[559] The \"Black or White\" video simultaneously premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time.[177] Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped introduce morphing to music videos.[560] It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video.[165]\n\"In the Closet\" featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson.[561] \"Remember the Time\" was set in ancient Egypt, and featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson.[562] The video for \"Scream\", directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations, and won \"Best Dance Video\", \"Best Choreography\", and \"Best Art Direction\".[563] The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child molestation in 1993.[564] A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music video ever made, at 7 million;[565] Romanek has contradicted this.[566] The \"Earth Song\" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.[567]",

    "content": "Earnings\nIn 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million.[240] Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997.[599] Jackson has been one of the wealthiest celebrities and musical artists; estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative 285 million to positive 350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007.[600][601] Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion.[602][603] Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated 300 million in royalties. He may have earned another 400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos.[604]\nIn 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the United States Tax Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over estate taxes.[605] The executors claimed that it was worth about 7 million, while the IRS that it was worth over 1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed 702 million; 505 million in taxes, and 197 million in penalties.[606] In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the estate was 111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was 4 million.[607]\nIn 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at 825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog.[608] In 2018, the figure was 400 million,[609] and by 2024, it rose to 600 million,[610] bringing Jackson's postmortem total to 3.3 billion.[611] Forbes has consistently recognized Jackson as one of the top-earning dead celebrities, and placed him at the top spot from 2010 to 2024, except for 2012, 2021, and 2022.[612][613]",
